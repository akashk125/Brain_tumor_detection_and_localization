# Brain_tumor_detection_and_localization
This project uses Convolution Neural Network and Yolo object detection to detect whether a brain tumor is present in a dataset and draws a bounding box around the tumor, if present in the image. The dataset consists of several images which contain brain scans from both healthy and tumor containing brains.
